 CSPC101 EXAM REVIEWER: SET THEORY, RELATIONS, DOMAIN & RANGE
This reviewer summarizes all key topics for your CSPC101 exam, covering Set Theory, Relations, Domain & Range with examples.

📌 1. SET THEORY
A set is a collection of distinct objects or elements.

🔹 Set Notation
Roster Method → Listing elements:

Example: 
𝐴
=
{
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
}
A={1,2,3,4}

Set-Builder Notation → Using conditions to define elements:

Example: 
𝐵
=
{
𝑥
∣
𝑥
>
0
,
𝑥
 is an integer
}
B={x∣x>0,x is an integer}

🔹 Types of Sets
Set Type	Definition	Example
Finite Set	Has a limited number of elements.	
𝑆
=
{
2
,
4
,
6
,
8
}
S={2,4,6,8}
Infinite Set	Has an unlimited number of elements.	
𝑆
=
{
1
,
2
,
3
,
…
 
}
S={1,2,3,…}
Empty (Null) Set	A set with no elements.	
𝑆
=
{
}
S={} or 
𝑆
=
∅
S=∅
Singleton Set	A set with only one element.	
𝑆
=
{
5
}
S={5}
Equal Sets	Two sets with exactly the same elements.	
𝐴
=
{
1
,
2
,
3
}
,
𝐵
=
{
3
,
2
,
1
}
⇒
𝐴
=
𝐵
A={1,2,3},B={3,2,1}⇒A=B
Equivalent Sets	Two sets with the same number of elements.	( A = {a,b,c}, B = {x,y,z} \Rightarrow
Subset	A set where all elements belong to another set.	
𝐴
=
{
1
,
2
}
,
𝐵
=
{
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
}
⇒
𝐴
⊂
𝐵
A={1,2},B={1,2,3,4}⇒A⊂B

𝐵
⊃
𝐴
B⊃A

,
6
}
U={1,2,3,4,5,6}
🔹 Power Sets
The power set of a set 
𝑆
S is the set of all subsets of 
𝑆
S.
Formula: If 
𝑆
S has 
𝑛
n elements, then the power set has 
2
𝑛
2 
n
  subsets.

Example: If 
𝑆
=
{
𝑎
,
𝑏
}
S={a,b}, then:
Power Set: 
𝑃
(
𝑆
)
=
{
∅
,
{
𝑎
}
,
{
𝑏
}
,
{
𝑎
,
𝑏
}
}
P(S)={∅,{a},{b},{a,b}}

📌 2. DOMAIN, RANGE, AND TYPES
A function is a relation where each input (domain) has exactly one output.

🔹 Domain & Range
Domain → The set of all possible inputs (x-values).

Range → The set of all possible outputs (y-values).

Example:
Given the function:
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2
f(x)=x 
2
 

Domain: 
𝑅
R (all real numbers)

Range: 
𝑦
≥
0
y≥0 (all non-negative numbers)

🔹 Types of Functions
Function Type	Definition	Example
One-to-One (Injective)	Each input has a unique output.	
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
2
𝑥
f(x)=2x
Onto (Surjective)	Every output has at least one input.	
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
3
f(x)=x 
3
 
Bijective	Both one-to-one and onto.	
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
+
1
f(x)=x+1
📌 3. RELATIONS & ANALYSIS
A relation is a set of ordered pairs 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
(x,y).

🔹 Types of Relations
Relation Type	Definition	Example
Reflexive	Every element relates to itself.	
𝑎
𝑅
𝑎
∀
𝑎
∈
𝐴
aRa∀a∈A
Symmetric	If 
𝑎
𝑅
𝑏
aRb, then 
𝑏
𝑅
𝑎
bRa.	
(
1
,
2
)
⇒
(
2
,
1
)
(1,2)⇒(2,1)
Transitive	If 
𝑎
𝑅
𝑏
aRb and 
𝑏
𝑅
𝑐
bRc, then 
𝑎
𝑅
𝑐
aRc.	
(
1
,
2
)
,
(
2
,
3
)
⇒
(
1
,
3
)
(1,2),(2,3)⇒(1,3)
Equivalence Relation	A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.	
=
,
≅
=,≅
🔹 Example: Relation Analysis
Set 
𝐴
=
{
1
,
2
,
3
}
A={1,2,3}, Relation 
𝑅
=
{
(
1
,
1
)
,
(
2
,
2
)
,
(
3
,
3
)
,
(
1
,
2
)
,
(
2
,
1
)
}
R={(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2),(2,1)}

Reflexive? ✅ Yes, because 
(
1
,
1
)
,
(
2
,
2
)
,
(
3
,
3
)
(1,1),(2,2),(3,3) exist.

Symmetric? ✅ Yes, because 
(
1
,
2
)
(1,2) and 
(
2
,
1
)
(2,1) exist.

Transitive? ❌ No, because 
(
1
,
2
)
(1,2) and 
(
2
,
3
)
(2,3) exist, but 
(
1
,
3
)
(1,3) is missing.

Thus, R is not an equivalence relation because it fails transitivity.

📌 FINAL REVIEW SUMMARY
✅ Set Theory → Covers set notation, types, power sets, and operations (union, intersection, etc.).
✅ Domain & Range → Defines input-output relationships in functions.
✅ Relations & Analysis → Relations can be reflexive, symmetric, transitive, or an equivalence relation.
